                        <h3>People in Kenya finally got to see a banned lesbian romance film - and they loved it</h3>

                        <p>
                            NAIROBI — Marie Ainomugisha’s WhatsApp notifications lit up within minutes of the ban on a film about a forbidden romance between two young women being temporarily lifted.
                            <br><br>
                            Her group chat was buzzing, and so were her DMs. It felt like nearly all of her friends were asking the same thing: Now that they were allowed to watch Rafiki, how would they get tickets?
                            <br><br>
                            As it turned out, Ainomugisha, a 24-year-old film editor, was the closest of everyone she knew to the only movie theater in Nairobi screening Rafiki. So she quickly hopped on her bike, rode the 1.5 miles from her office to Prestige Cinema, and scooped up a handful of tickets for the first showing: Sunday at 10 a.m. She’d been planning on going out Saturday night to celebrate her 24th birthday, but quickly canceled those plans. This, she thought, was more important.
                            <br><br>
                            Ainomugisha’s reaction was mirrored by hundreds of other young Kenyans, especially in the creative and LGBT communities, who had been gripped by the drama surrounding Rafiki. It all started when the Kenya Film Classification Board banned all screenings of the film in the country in April because, according to the board, it “promoted lesbianism” and went against the country’s dominant values. That meant, despite Rafiki being the first Kenyan film to be shown at the Cannes Film Festival; despite the fact that it was shot in Kenya, was directed by a Kenyan, and features an all-Kenyan cast, Kenyans could not watch Rafiki in their own country. Since the ban, it has also shown in Durban, South Africa; Zanzibar, Tanzania; and Toronto, Canada.
                            <br><br>
                            So on Sept. 12, Wanuri Kahiu, who directed the film, sued the classification board, urging them to lift the ban so that she could submit it as an Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Language Film. (According to Academy rules, a film has to be shown for seven consecutive days in the country where it was produced in order to be considered a nominee.)
                            <br><br>
                            And she won.
                        </p>

                            Ladies and Gentlemen, you might want to take off your trousers and slip into a bathrobe because things are about to get pretty steamy in here.
                            <br><br>
                            I’m beyond excited to officially unveil for you the beautiful cover of my upcoming book, “Strangers Assume My Girlfriend Is My Nurse!”
                            <br><br>
                            I’m sure many of you temporarily lost consciousness when your eyes fell upon the sheer sexiness of my girlfriend, Hannah, and I posing in such a sultry position, so I’ll give you a minute to regain your strength before I continue. I hope you’ll wipe up your drool and keep reading because I have a few very important things to say about this book.
                            <br><br>
                            My name is Shane Burcaw, and I was born with a lovely muscle-wasting disease called Spinal Muscular Atrophy. I’m working really hard to use my time on this earth to create a positive, lasting impact. Specifically, my goal is to change the way society looks at disability. This book is the next step in that journey.
                            <br><br>
                            One of the biggest stigmas about people with disabilities is that we are incapable and unworthy of romantic relationships. To give you an example, I run a YouTube channel with Hannah, and every time we post a new episode, people inevitably comment with theories as to why on earth we are dating. Here are just a few of my favorites:
                            <br><br>
                            “Don’t get me wrong - he seems like a good dude - but I ain’t buying it. She’s either his nurse or good friend and this is an act, or she’s got a couple screws loose.”
                            <br><br>
                            “Ask yourself, would you date him? NO, YOU WOULDN’T. What is the catch here?”
                            <br><br>
                            “This [relationship] is abnormal and frankly disgusting.”
                            <br><br>
                            Aren’t these fun? Jokes aside, this is but a small indication of the vast and innumerable ways that people with disabilities are discriminated against on a daily basis. I am determined to change that situation.
                            <br><br>
                            My strategy is humor. In “Strangers Assume My Girlfriend Is My Nurse” I use funny stories from my life to show readers that using a wheelchair is not some horrid, depressing existence. I’m a person, and my disability should not invoke pity or aversion, but rather, respect and love and kindness, just like we all deserve.
                            <br><br>
                            If you personally support that idea, please please please consider sharing this post. My ability to make a difference in this world is solely hinged upon spreading my story to as many people as possible, and YOU hold that power for me!
                            <br><br>
                            In celebration of my new book, and to raise funds for my nonprofit organization (which teaches children across the country about disability awareness and pride), I am hosting a HUGE online event scheduled for 8pm EST on November 27th. Entertainment will include a reading from “Strangers Assume”, an open Q&A where you can ask me anything you’d like, never-before-heard stories, and other special surprises! Your ticket purchase will help us provide adaptive technology to individuals living with muscular dystrophy in December 2018.
